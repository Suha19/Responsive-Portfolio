                <p>The Canon EOS 7D Mark II Wi-Fi Adapter Kit adds the convenience of Wi-Fi速 compatibility* to the features you can now utilize with the EOS 7D Mark II camera. By simply inserting the new Wi-Fi Adapter** W-E1 into the SD card slot, you can take advantage of Wi-Fi速* capabilities such as remote shooting or viewing and transferring still images and movies (MP4) using a compatible smart device (with the Camera Connect app*) or a computer (using EOS Utility). When combined with the robust features of the EOS 7D Mark II, including the 20.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor, up to 10.0 fps shooting speed, Dual Pixel CMOS AF for brilliant Live View AF and more, these new Wi-Fi速 capabilities give you a more expansive interaction with your EOS 7D Mark II than ever before.

                        In addition to this new Wi-Fi Adapter Kit, the EOS 7D Mark II is also available in a bundle with the Wi-Fi Adapter W-E1 and the EF-S 18-135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM lens. This gives you the full feature set of the EOS 7D Mark II with convenient Wi-Fi速 compatibility, along with a lens boasting NANO USM AF for fast, fluid and nearly silent operation during video and still shooting, so you can get the shots you want while being as discreet as you need to be.</p>
